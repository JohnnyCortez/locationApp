# LocationApp
Submitted by: Johnny A. Cortez

A fun web app that allows you to find events from different locations. I used PostgreSQL as the backend. 

## Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

-The web app uses React to display data from the API.
-The web app is connected to a PostgreSQL database, with an appropriately structured events table.
-The web app displays the title of the app.
-A visual interface allows the user to select a location they would like to view.
-Clicking on a location shows a list of all items from the events table that corresponds to that location.
-Each location detail page should have its own unique URL.

## Video Walkthrough
